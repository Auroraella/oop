// Question 2 - Inheritance and Polymorphism
// 2-1. (15 marks) Define and implement a class named Helicopter, which represents a special kind of air vehicle. It is to be defined by inheriting from the AirVehicle class. The Helicopter class has the following constructor:

// Helicopter(int w, string n)     // creates a Helicopter with weight w and name n

// string name;                    // name of the Helicopter
// void fly(int headwind, int minutes);
// Helicopter has a default constructor that does nothing.

// Following the principles of encapsulation and information hiding, set the proper access modifiers for the attributes and provide methods to access the objectâ€™s data. The get and set function names should be the attribute name prefixed with "get_" or "set_" respectively.

// Your Helicopter class should define the fly() method, which was inherited from AirVehicle. When a helicopter flies, it will use 0.18% of its fuel for every minute it flies, unless there is a headwind of 40km/hour or more, and then it will use 0.4% of its fuel for each minute it flies. For every kilogram over 5670kg, it will use 0.01% extra fuel each minute.

// E.g. if fuel is at 80%, and a 5690kg helicopter flies for 10 minutes into a 45km/hour headwind, the fuel will be 80% minus (0.4 * 10 minutes) minus (0.01 * 20kg * 10 minutes) = 74%.

// After each flight, increment numberOfFlights by 1.

// If a flight would result in the Helicopter finishing with less than 20% fuel it will not take off and fly, wont use fuel, and will not increment numberOfFlights. 

// Save your code in Helicopter.cpp and Helicopter.h, so we can check that your code compiles. Implement a program with a main method that tests your code in a file called main-2-1.cpp.
